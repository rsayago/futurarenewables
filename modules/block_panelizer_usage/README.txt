Provides new views fields which can be added to the Custom Block Library page (or any view of Custom Blocks) which lists all the Panelized content on which that block is displayed.

Specifically, this offer three fields:

* Block by Region Report: A report of the block regions in which blocks appear.
* Blocks in Panelizered Display Modes Report: A report of the panelizered display modes in which blocks appear.
* Blocks in Panelizered Nodes Report: A report of the panelizered nodes on which blocks appear.

All these fields are linked to a place in which that block can be removed or edited.

Once installed (as usual), you will have to edit a view and add these fields.

This module provides a field for views of Custom Blocks, but does not
add those fields to any views when it is enabled.

To see these reports, you have to add the Block Panelizer Usage field(s) to a
view of Custom Blocks.
